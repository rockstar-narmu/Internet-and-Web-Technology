    <p>A long black is made by pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, retaining the crema, unlike Caffè Americano.[124] Milk is added in various forms to an espresso: steamed milk makes a caffè latte,[125] equal parts steamed milk and milk froth make a cappuccino,[124] and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a caffè macchiato.[126] A flat white is prepared by adding steamed hot milk (microfoam) to two espresso shots.</p>
