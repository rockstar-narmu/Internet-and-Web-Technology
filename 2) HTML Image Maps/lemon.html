    <p>Dried lime, also known as: black lime; noomi basra (Iraq); limoo amani (Iran); and loomi (Oman), is a lime that has lost its water content, usually after having spent a majority of its drying time in the sun. They are used whole, sliced, or ground, as a spice in Middle Eastern dishes. Originating in the Persian Gulf – hence the Iranian name limoo amani and the Iraqi name noomi basra ("lemon from Basra") – dried limes are popular in cookery across the Middle East.</p>
